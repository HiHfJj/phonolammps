Example of usage using command line interface
---------------------------------------------

To use phonoLAMMPS the following files are needed:
- VASP POSCAR type file containing the crystal unit cell
- LAMMPS input file containing the defintion of the potential and crystal unit cell
- Other files containing additional parameters may be needed depending on LAMMPS input.

IMPORTANT: in.lammps should contain the SAME definition of the unit cell as in POSCAR file
either using LAMMPS scripting (in.lammps) or reading the coordinates from external data
file (in.lammps_data). Because the definition of the potential in LAMMPS may be complicated
these two files should be written carefully by the user.

Run this to generate a FORCE_CONSTANTS file and show a preview of the phonon band structure.
Use --dim to change the size of the supercells used to calculate the force constants.
--pa can be used to define the primitive axis in a same manner as phonopy (this option only
affects the phonon band structure preview)

# phonolammps in.lammps -c POSCAR_unitcell --dim 3 3 3 -p
